## apps
None :-). Maybe, one day but probability is quite low !

## framework
TODO : the goal is to define something based on isolated component (kind of modules), communicating by a kind of common layer (like web service but local).
Component isolatation is mandatory, with scope for variable, function etc to avoid any global stuff of side effect from a component to another.

HTML/CSS visu must be separated from behavior (javascript) as possible.

diagrams are done with draw.io (and store in diags folder)

### electron

## dev env
